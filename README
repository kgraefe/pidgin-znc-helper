Talk Like A Pirate will work with PURPLE_MAJOR_VERSION 2, but you must compile
it with the minor version of purple that you plan to use it with.

You must have glib and purple development headers and libraries in order
to build this package.  On Debian Etch just do the following and you'll
get everything you need:

apt-get install pidgin-dev

Everything should build with the customary:

./configure
make
make install

Remember that "./configure --help" will show all the options available
to help cope with odd setups, installations, and paths.
